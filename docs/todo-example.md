# TODO Documentation Example

This document provides an example of how to structure feature implementation plans in this project. It demonstrates the expected format for phases, testing requirements, and documentation standards.

## Structure Overview

A proper implementation plan should include:

1. **Clear Project Status** - Current feature, phase, and goal
2. **Feature Breakdown** - Organized list of all features to implement
3. **Phased Implementation** - Logical grouping by complexity and dependencies
4. **Testing Requirements** - Specific unit and integration tests for each phase
5. **Technical Details** - Architecture decisions and implementation specifics
6. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes for completion

## Phase Structure Requirements

### Phase Format
Each phase must follow this structure:

```markdown
### Phase X: [Descriptive Name] [STATUS]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low] - [Brief justification]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Dependencies**: [List of prerequisite phases]

#### X.1 [Sub-feature Name]
- Implementation detail 1
- Implementation detail 2
- Implementation detail 3

#### X.2 [Sub-feature Name]
- Implementation detail 1
- Implementation detail 2

**Phase X Testing:**
- **Unit Tests**: [Specific unit test descriptions]
- **Integration Tests**: [Specific integration test descriptions]
- **Unit Tests**: [Additional unit tests as needed]
```

### Status Indicators
- `[TODO]` - Phase not yet started
- `[COMPLETED]` - Phase fully implemented and tested

### Testing Requirements
Every phase MUST include specific, automated tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components with mock data
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows with temporary files/directories
- Avoid manual testing - all tests should be runnable via `go test`
- Use generated test data, not user interactions

## Example Implementation

The current PLAN.md demonstrates this structure with the History Management Features:

### Phase Organization
1. **Foundation Phase** (Environment/Location) - Low complexity, no dependencies
2. **Core System Phase** (Configuration/CLI) - Medium complexity, depends on foundation
3. **User Operations Phase** (Clear/Delete/Search) - High complexity, depends on core
4. **UI Enhancement Phase** (TUI Config) - Medium complexity, depends on core + operations
5. **Polish Phase** (Quality of Life) - Low complexity, depends on all core features

### Testing Example
From Phase 1 (History Location and Environment Configuration):

```markdown
**Phase 1 Testing:**
- **Unit Tests**: Environment variable parsing and precedence logic in `remfs` package
- **Unit Tests**: Directory migration functions with mock filesystem scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: CLI commands with `--history` flag using temporary directories
- **Integration Tests**: Backward compatibility with existing `content/` directory structure
- **Unit Tests**: Error handling for invalid paths, missing permissions, and filesystem failures
```

## Best Practices

### Phase Dependencies
- Clearly specify which phases must complete before starting
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Group related functionality together
- Prioritize foundation work first

### Testing Specificity
- Name the specific packages/functions being tested
- Specify test data sources (mock, generated, temporary files)
- Include error conditions and edge cases
- Distinguish between unit and integration test scope

### Implementation Details
- Break large features into logical sub-components
- Include technical architecture decisions
- Specify file/directory structures when relevant
- Document backward compatibility considerations

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

This example should be referenced in the project's CLAUDE.md file to ensure consistent planning across all features. When creating new implementation plans, refer to this structure and adapt it to your specific feature requirements.
